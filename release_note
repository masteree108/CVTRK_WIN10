    (NTUT)(TOOL) add a serivce for auto executing vott_tracker.py

    This is a test tool, you can use this tool like below instance
    run vott.exe(build VoTT to exe file),but vott_tracker.exe no exectuing!
    maybe your vott.exe hasn't includes some service about NTUT auto
    track, so you can use this service to instead of those tracking service
    on the vott

      4. add ID check and show ID on the debug windows
      5. read frameExtractionRate from project.vott file
      6. modify code to support fps equals 5 and 6 which is user setted on the VoTT

    about fixed issue:
      (WRITE_JSON_CLASS) fix regions id all the same in the json file that will cause bbox disappears on the VoTT
      (LOG) fix issue that is vott_source_info.tmp file always open to cause system can not remove
